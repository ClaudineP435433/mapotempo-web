      # From Here "Matrix Routing API Developer's Guide"
      # Recommendations for Splitting Matrixes
      # The best way to split a matrix request is to split it into parts with only few start positions and many
      # destinations. The number of the start positions should be between 3 and 15, depending on the size
      # of the area covered by the matrix. The matrices should be split into requests sufficiently small to
      # ensure a response time of 30 seconds each. The number of the destinations in one request is limited
      # to 100.

      # Request should not contain more than 15 starts per request
      # 500 to get response before 30 seconds timeout
